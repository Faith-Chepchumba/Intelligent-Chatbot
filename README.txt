•	**Dynamic Chat Interface:** Custom message bubbles, avatars, and user input fields for an intuitive chat experience.

•	**Local Data Storage:** Saves user interactions using **Core Data** for persistence, allowing users to resume chats after app restarts.

**Technologies Used**

•	**Programming Language:** Swift

•	**Frameworks:** UIKit, Core Data, URLSession

•	**Backend Service:** Dialogflow (for NLP and AI)

•	**Tools:** Xcode for iOS development, Git for version control
